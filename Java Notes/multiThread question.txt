Discuss the differences between user-level threads and kernel-level threads.
How does context switching work in multithreading?
Explain the producer-consumer problem and how to solve it using threads.
Describe different thread scheduling algorithms (e.g., First-Come-First-Served, Priority scheduling).
How can you handle exceptions in multithreaded programs



Beginner

Print Numbers: Write a program that creates two threads. One thread should print odd numbers from 1 to 10, and the other thread should print even numbers from 2 to 10. (This is a good exercise to understand how to create threads and get them to run concurrently.)

Race Condition:  Simulate a race condition by creating two threads that increment a shared counter variable. How can you fix this race condition using synchronization? (This will introduce you to the concept of race conditions and how to prevent them using synchronization mechanisms.)

Intermediate

Producer-Consumer Problem: Implement a producer-consumer pattern using threads and a shared buffer. The producer thread should generate items and add them to the buffer, while the consumer thread should remove items from the buffer and process them. (This is a classic multi-threading problem that teaches you about communication and synchronization between threads.)

Countdown Latch:  Write a program that uses a countdown latch to synchronize multiple worker threads. The main thread should wait until all worker threads finish their tasks before proceeding. (This will introduce you to countdown latches, a useful synchronization tool for waiting on multiple tasks.)
