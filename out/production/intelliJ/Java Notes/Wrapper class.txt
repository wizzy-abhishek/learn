Wrapper class is a class that gives us the power to convert primitive data types to object and object into primitive , so we can perform more opertions on that object.

When we box any primitive data type with the object of that Wrapper class then that is called boxing.
Example :- int i = 15 ;
	   Integer a = Integer.valueof(i);
But if we  Integer b = i ; 
	This is known as auto - boxing.
Here primitive is wrapped around an object.
We wrapped i with a and b 

Well
When we assign the value of wrapper obj to a primitive data type that is called unboxing
Example :- Float h = Float.valueof("12.5");
	   float x = h.floatValue();  (This is unboxing)
	   float y = h ; (Here , the method floatValue() is automatically called , Hence it is know as AUTO-UNBOXING. )
In general words getting the value of data type from an object to the primitive data type is unboxing.
