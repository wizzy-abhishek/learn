String buffer uses an array of char and it has predefined space .
StringBuffer are mutable 
As StringBuffer gets overflow it automatically insreaeses the size of the array 
StringBuffer is Thread safe means no two thread can utilize a thread simultaneously means the actions used on it are syncronized 
Thats why its lil slower

StringBuilder arent thread safe
